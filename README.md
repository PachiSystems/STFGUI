STFGUI
======

GUI for encoding (HandBrake), subbing (MP4Box) and metadata (AtomicParsley) utilities.

Another of my projects that has fallen way behind. This project needs some TLC and could be potentially a nice little app to take the stress out of organising a large MP4 collection in iTunes. Again, the biggest problem for me at the moment is finding time to work on these things, but I will get around to it one day.
